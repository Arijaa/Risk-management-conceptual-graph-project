# Conceptual Graph-Based Recommendation System for Risk Management (RM) Issues

ðŸš€ Welcome to our project! This project involves creating a conceptual graph-based recommendation system for monitoring risk management (RM) issues. ðŸ“‰ Tasks included implementing an NLP pipeline to extract, clean, and analyze data, developing a GNN architecture for graph construction, integrating machine learning models into a web application, designing the app's architecture, and evaluating system performance. ðŸ’¼

## Overview

The key tasks involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Implementing an NLP pipeline to extract, clean, and preprocess textual data related to risk management issues from various sources such as documents, reports, and communication channels.

2. **Graph Construction**: Developing a GNN architecture for constructing conceptual graphs representing relationships between risk management issues, entities, and concepts. The graph structure captures the semantic connections and dependencies among different elements of the RM domain.

3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrating machine learning models into the recommendation system to analyze the constructed graphs, extract patterns, and identify potential risk management issues or trends. This includes training models for classification, clustering, and anomaly detection tasks.

4. **Web Application Development**: Designing and implementing a web application to interactively visualize and explore the recommendations generated by the system. The application provides an intuitive user interface for risk management professionals to review insights, track issues, and take appropriate actions.

5. **System Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and usability. Conducting thorough testing and validation to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the system in real-world RM scenarios.
